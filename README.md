Test project I did, in order to play around with Meteor.js framework and see/learn what it can do.

Description: this pet project (completed 50%) is to showcase the following: 
1. A system of creating and maintaining events in a calendar for Starcraft players 
2. A page to learn Starcraft strategies based on easily accessible youtube videos 
3. A page of identifying other players, based on an easily visualised d3.js chart.

Characteristics:
- full javascript (frontend + backend)
- mongoDB database
- ironrouter for routing
- heavy use of the Meteor publish/subscribe functionality for learning purposes
- additional external libraries like : bootstrap, moment.js, d3.js, imgur API, etc

Maybe someone will find this useful / fun to go through.
